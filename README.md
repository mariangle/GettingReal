# GettingReal Project
This is the second project I've worked and it was made with WPF. SandrasGroup wanted a booking platform to make it easy for its clients to book a freelance photographer. It would've made more sense to make it as website, however we were limited to only work on something we've worked with in school. With the timeframe, the goal wasn't having a finished product but a prototype.

# The Code
The software pattern MVVM has been used to structure seperate program logic and user interface controls. To save/load users and bookings I've used textfiles.
