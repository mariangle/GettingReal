# GettingReal Project
This project was developed using WPF. The client, SandrasGroup, required a booking platform that would enable its customers to easily book a freelance photographer. Although it would have made more sense to develop a website, we were limited to working with technologies we had learned in school. Due to the limited timeframe, the focus was on creating a prototype rather than a finished product.

# The Code
The software pattern MVVM has been used to structure seperate program logic and user interface controls.
